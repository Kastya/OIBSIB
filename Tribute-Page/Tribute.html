      <p>Appearance
        In real life, Oda is a Japanese man of average height, with few (if any) distinguishing features. When not in formal settings, he favors casual, Western-style clothing.Like most mangaka, Oda typically uses outlandish caricatures to represent himself in printed works. The most common of these is a striped tropical fish, best known for "giving" all of Oda's weekly comments in Shonen Jump's table of contents; in more detailed depictions (such as the Color Walks' Monochrome Talk headers), this fish is usually given human ears and affixed atop a human body like a mask.</p><br>
    </ul>
     <br><p style="background-color:rgb(74, 74, 78); color:white; font-weight: bold; padding: 16px;">Eiichiro Oda has received several awards and titles.</p>
